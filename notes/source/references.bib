        Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book
            provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of
            causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept
            into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the
            fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics,
        philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences.
            Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative,
        counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises
            simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between
            causal connections and statistical associations. The book will open
            the way for including causal analysis in the standard curricula of
            statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social
            sciences, and economics. Students in these fields will find natural
            models, simple inferential procedures, and precise mathematical
            definitions of causal concepts that traditional texts have evaded
            or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led
            to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in
            statistics, philosophy, computer science, social science, and
            economics. Cited in more than 3,000 scientific publications, it
            continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of
            statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl
            elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a
            panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.
            Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a
            wide variety of fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful
            relationships from data, predict effects of actions and policies,
        assess explanations of reported events, or form theories of causal
            understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and
            invaluable.
